## Reflections and Production Readiness

* Cache Invalidation: Right now, we're using a simple time-based expiration (5 minutes). We could implement a more nuanced approach using something like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/).

* Error Handling: Our current setup is pretty basic. We could use a library like [`react-error-boundary`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) to provide better error fallbacks and logging.

* Performance Optimization: For large datasets, we might want to implement pagination or virtual scrolling to improve performance.

* Testing: We definitely need more test coverage. I'd start with some unit tests for our hooks using [`@testing-library/react-hooks`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library).

* TypeScript: We could make our types more specific. For example, instead of using `unknown` for our data, we could define interfaces for our API responses.

* Production Readiness

To get this project production-ready, I would add the following:
   - A proper build process (Webpack or Vite)
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Monitoring and logging (e.g. Sentry)
   - Security measures (dependency scanning, HTTPS enforcement)
   - Performance optimizations (code splitting, lazy loading)
   - Accessibility improvements (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)

I'd prioritize adding tests and improving error handling first, as these will make the codebase easier to maintain as we add new features.
